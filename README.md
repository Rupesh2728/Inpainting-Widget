<h2 align="left">Challenges and Solutions</h2>

<h4>Challenge :</h4>
<p> Generating a real-time mask independent of the brush color posed a significant technical challenge.</p>

<h4>Solution :</h4>
  
<p> To overcome this, I analyzed the workflow of the react-canvas-draw library and its <CanvasDraw /> component in depth. By leveraging the useRef() hook and implementing advanced filtering techniques, I successfully generated the mask, ensuring it remains unaffected by variations in brush color. </p>
